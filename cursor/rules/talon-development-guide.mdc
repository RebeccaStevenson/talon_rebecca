# Talon Voice Development Guide

This guide provides an overview of how to work with [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/docs/) in this community repository. Talon uses `.talon` files for voice commands and Python (`.py`) files for more complex logic.

The user's scripts are located in `~/.talon/user`. The current workspace is the `community` repository, a collection of shared Talon scripts.

## Project Structure

This is a Talon community repository. The structure is as follows:

-   `apps/`: Application-specific commands (e.g., Chrome, VSCode).
-   `core/`: Core functionalities like editing text, managing windows, etc. This is a good place to look for existing actions.
-   `custom/`: **All new, user-specific scripts and commands should be created in this directory.**
-   `lang/`: Language-specific commands (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
-   `tags/`: Defines tags that can be used to enable/disable sets of commands.

Each module often consists of:
-   A `.py` file for Python logic (defining actions).
-   A `.talon` file for defining voice commands.

## Adding New Commands

1.  **Create a Python file in `custom/`:** Define a new action in a `.py` file (e.g., [`custom/html.py`](mdc:custom/html.py)).
    ```python
    from talon import Module, actions

    mod = Module()

    @mod.action_class
    class Actions:
        def my_new_action():
            # implementation
            pass
    ```
2.  **Create a Talon file in `custom/`:** Create a `.talon` file to define the voice command that triggers the action.
    ```talon
    # Set the context for when the command is active
    app: vscode
    -
    # The voice command
    my new command: user.my_new_action()
    ```
3.  **Define Context:** Use a `Context` object in your Python file to scope actions or tags to specific applications or situations.
    ```python
    from talon import Context, Module, actions

    mod = Module()
    mod.tag("html", desc="a tag for html commands")

    ctx = Context()
    # This context applies when inside vscode or cursor
    ctx.matches = r"""
    app: vscode
    app: cursor
    """
    # And it enables the user.html tag
    ctx.tags = ["user.html"]
    ```

## Debugging Tips

### `KeyError: "Action '...' is not declared."`

This is a common error that occurs when a `.talon` file calls an action that hasn't been defined in any `.py` file.

-   **Check for typos:** Ensure the action name in your `.talon` file matches the definition in your `.py` file.
-   **Look for existing actions:** Before creating a new action, search the `core/` directory. For example, instead of creating a new way to get selected text, we found `actions.edit.selected_text()` in [`core/edit/edit.py`](mdc:core/edit/edit.py).
